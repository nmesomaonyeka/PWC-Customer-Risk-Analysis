# PWC Customer Retention Dashboard Analysis

## Executive Summary  
As part of my role in a PwC job simulation, I was tasked with assisting one of PwC's call center clients, two Power BI dashboards were developed to address customer retention challenges. These dashboards focus on identifying at-risk customers, analyzing churn drivers, and providing actionable insights to proactively reduce attrition. The analysis leverages customer demographics, service usage, account behavior, and financial metrics to guide strategic decision-making.

## Business Problem  
PhoneNow faced critical challenges in retaining customers:  
- **Reactive Retention Strategies**: Interventions occurred only after contract termination.  
- **Limited Predictive Insights**: Excel-based analyses failed to forecast at-risk customers.  
- **High Churn in Key Segments**: Fiber optic users and short-term contract holders showed elevated attrition.  
- **Operational Blind Spots**: Lack of clarity on payment method impacts, service dissatisfaction triggers, and demographic trends.
